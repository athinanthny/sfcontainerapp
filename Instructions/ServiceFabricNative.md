# ContainersSFLab - Service Fabric Native application

The instructions below walk you through packaging an existing ASP.NET application for Service Fabric clusters, using the Service Fabric Native application model.

For more info about Service Fabric application models, look here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-technical-overview#application-and-service-concepts

Requirements for running the lab are

- Windows 10 Enterprise or Professional Edition or Windows Server 2016
- Docker for Windows
- Visual Studio 2017 15.7
- Service Fabric SDK 3.1 and Service Fabric Runtime 6.2
- An Azure subscription: If you do not have one, you can get a trial subscription here:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

## Containerize an existing ASP.NET application using Visual Studio and Service Fabric

### Lab Overview

In this lab, you will be guided through the following tasks:

1. Build a Docker container for Windows, with an existing ASP.NET web
    application

1. Create an Azure Container Registry, and push your container to a
    registry

1. Create an Azure Service Fabric application with your container

1. Deploy your application to Azure Service Fabric
  
## Build a Docker container for Windows, with an existing ASP.NET web application

**Goal:** The goal of this section is to have an ASP.NET application running in a Docker container on your Windows 10 developer machine.

### Process

| **Step**                           | **Procedure**                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Run the application                | Run the existing ASP.NET application to verify its functionality, using Visual Studio and IIS Express. |
| Create a Docker container          | Create a docker container.                                                                             |
| Run the application in a container | Run and debug the application running in a container, using Visual Studio.                             |

## Run the Application

In this section we will test the ASP.NET application using Visual Studio
and IIS
Express.

| **Step** | **Action** | **Result** |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1        | Open the solution **eShopLegacyWebForms.sln**, which you will find in the **\\Lab\\eShopLegacyWebFormsSolution** folder on the desktop. <br><br> **Note** <br> Visual Studio will ask for login, choose **Not now** and choose a theme.                                                 | Visual Studio will open, and you will see one project with an ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio.                                      |
| 2        | Expand the **Default.aspx** file in the **Solution Explorer**, then open the **Default.aspx.cs** file in Visual Studio and set a breakpoint at line **25**.                                                                                                | This will break the application once a browser requests the home page.                                                                       |
| 3        | Change the **Solution Configuration** to **Debug** and press **F5** to start debugging the application.                                                                                                                                       | The application will now build, and Edge will open with the application when it’s ready.                                                     |
| 4        | When the breakpoint is hit, click **F5** to continue code execution.                                                                                                                   | The applications home page shows up in Edge.                                                                                                 |
| 5        | The application simulates a simple web shop administrative interface. Feel free to browse around the application to see details of the various products and some of the functionality. | **Note:** The application is setup to use mock data loaded from source files, so all changes will be reverted once the debug session closes. |
| 6        | Press **Shift+F5** to stop the debugging                                                                                                                                               | Debugging stops.                                                                                                                             |

### Completion

You’ve now complete debugging an ASP.NET application using Visual Studio
and IIS Express.

## Create a Docker container

In this section we will create a docker container image to run the
ASP.NET application eShopLegacyWebForms, which requires Internet
Information Server (IIS) to be running in the container.

| **Step** | **Action** | **Result** |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Publish eShopLegacyWebForms application to a folder from Visual Studio by: <br><br> 1.  **Right-Clicking** the **eShopLegacyWebForms** project and choose **Publish** <br> 2.  Choose **Folder** <br> 3.  Click **Publish** | The web application is now published to a folder and ready to be deployed in to a container image. |
| 2 | Open **PowerShell** and change directory to **“C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\<br>Lab\\eShopLegacyWebFormsSolution\\src\\eShopLegacyWebForms”** | |
| 3|Create a new DockerFile (no file extension) and open it in Notepad, by running the following commands: <br><br> 1. New-Item Dockerfile <br> 2. Notepad Dockerfile <br> 3. A blank Notepad will show up.||
| 4| Add the following content: <br><br> FROM microsoft/aspnet:4.7.1-windowsservercore-ltsc2016 <br> COPY bin/Release/Publish /inetpub/wwwroot|
| 5 | **Save and close** the file| The Dockerfile contains instructions for the docker engine on how to build a container, when running the “docker build” command in this directory.|
| 6 | In PowerShell run the command <br> **“docker build . -t eshopweb:1.0”**<br> in the directory **“C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\<br>Lab\\eShopLegacyWebFormsSolution\\src\\eShopLegacyWebForms”** | This command will tell the Docker host to build a container image and tag it eshopweb:1.0, using the instructions in the Dockerfile.
| 7 | Run the command **docker images** to see the container images cached on your machine | You should see an image with the repository: eshopweb and the tag: 1.0. |

### Completion

You’ve now published the ASP.NET application eShopLegacyWebForms and
built a docker container image with the application.

### Completion

In this section of the lab, we created a container image with our
application, and ran it. Finally, we used environment variables to
configure the application running in the
container.

## Create an Azure Container Registry, and push your container to a registry

**Goal:** The goal of this section is to publish the container image to
a private Azure Container Registry.

### Completion

In this section of the lab, we’ve created a private container registry
as a repository to store your container images.

## Build, tag and push the container

In this section we will prepare our container image to be uploaded, by

### Completion

In this section of the lab, we’ve tagged our container image and
uploaded it to our private container registry, ready to be deployed to
any container host.

## Pull the container image and run it locally

In this section we’ll do a final validation of being able to pull down
the container image.

**Note:** If you don’t want to wait for the image to be pushed to the
registry, skip step 1 and 2 in this section.

our private container registry, simulating a deployment, and validated
the container can be run and the application works.

### Completion

In this section of the lab, we’ve created a local Service Fabric cluster

## Apply container policies and upgrade the application

In this section we will enable parameterization of our application
configuration and apply resource policies to the container. We will also
roll-out an upgrade to the Service Fabric application.

### Completion

In this section of the lab, we’ve parameterized our configuration,
applied resource governance and upgraded our application in the Service
Fabric cluster.
